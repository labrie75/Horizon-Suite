# Pipeline Updates

The project has a local pipeline at `pipeline.md` (root). Update it when:

- The user says "add to the log", "log this", "add to pipeline", "add to upcoming notes", or similar
- We fix a bug — add a Changelog entry and move the bug to Closed/Fixed with `BUG` FIXED
- We complete a planned change — add a Changelog entry and move to Closed/Fixed with `FEAT`/`MOD`/`IMPR` CLOSED
- The user reports a new bug — add under Open Items with `BUG` OPEN, date, optional [P2], and brief description
- The user shares a plan or idea — add under Open Items with appropriate tag (`FEAT`, `MOD`, `IMPR`, `IDEA`)

**Entry format:** `tag` `status` `YYYY-MM-DD` [priority] Title. Optional detail or → plan link.

**Tags:** `BUG` (defects), `FEAT` (new features), `MOD` (module-specific), `IMPR` (improvements/refactors), `IDEA` (backlog/speculative), `DOC` (documentation)

**Status:** `OPEN` (active), `FIXED` (resolved bugs), `CLOSED` (done or dropped)

**Priority** (optional, for OPEN items): `P0` (major), `P1` (minor), `P2` (patch)

**Format conventions:**
- **Changelog:** `YYYY-MM-DD — One-line summary.` (newest first)
- **Open Items / Closed/Fixed:** Use tag + status + date + optional [priority] + title
- Use `YYYY-MM-DD` for dates. Keep entries one line when possible.
